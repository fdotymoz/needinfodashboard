A handy Bugzilla needinfo dashboard for managing needinfo flags for teams. The main management page
lists active needinfos broken down into five columns - developer related needinfos on open, tracked,
and closed bugs, and release management related needinfos. Each column provides links to both
Bugzilla bug lists as well as a need info details sub page. The details page provides a list of
each needinfo matched to the bugzilla comment when the flag was set, as well as additional meta
data such as bug title, severity, priority, and assignee. A basic set of bulk action options are
also provided.

Note authentication through a Bugzilla API key is required for visibility of security related bugs
and for access to bulk actions. API keys can be generated through Bugzilla account preferences. See
the dashboard settings for API key configuration and other display options.

Improvements and bug fixes for the dashboard are welcome!

If you would like to add an additional team to this dashboard submit a new team specific json config
file with an updated 'developers' entry and update the 'team-select' select in the index file. See
js/media.json for an example of the json format.

For testing changes there's a switch in each json config file that will point the dashboard at the test
instance of Bugzilla Mozilla maintains. For API key generation or new accounts generation on the test
instance ask in chat.mozilla.org's bugzilla.mozilla.org channel.

This dashboard is developed and maintained by Jim Mathies. Starting codebase was based on Bob Hood's
Need Info Leaderboard dashnboard.
